describe nitty-gritty concept of react and redux library

# React 
  - what is React?
    - js library for user interfaces
      - encapusulation and increase reusability
      - state management of each component
        - alternative redux
        - less flexible
## HOCs, render props
  - HOCs: 
  - render props: function prop to render another component
## Performance

  - Component and PureComponent and shouldComponentUpdate method
  - Immutability: 
    - immutable data structure
      - structure sharing:
      - trie:

# Redux Thunk
